Hiera-json is in end-of-life
=====

As of the release of Hiera 1.1.0, hiera-json has been incorporated into the
hiera codebase. The standalone hiera-json is only needed for releases of
Hiera prior to 1.1.0, which are all in bug-fix only mode. The 1.x branch is
for those older versions of hiera and is only open for urgent bug-fixes.
However, do not submit fixes against this repository.

What do I do with bugs?
=====

File bugs for hiera-json against hiera itself and submit patches as pull
requests against hiera as well.
